# folding poetry

Folding poetry is a website for collaborating on poetry completely randomly together with complete strangers. It's basically the old game of writing a line, folding it down and passing it on. 

Since the whole project is about collaboration, I want to make the development collaborative as well.

Check out the project at [foldingpoetry.com](http://www.foldingpoetry.com), then if you enjoy it and have some ideas on how to improve it, here's how to get started

## Getting started
1. This project is written in PHP and thus requires a local server to be able to run. Use something like MAMP for mac to set this up. 
2. Set up a MySQL database named folding_poetry
3. Import the database tables from the XML file included in the project folder. This will set up the tables and fill them with some test content.
